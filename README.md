Week 14 Homework - Handlebars, Express, Node

THis is a burger tracker with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

Eat-Da-Burger! is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger -- "waiting to be devoured". Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. The burgers are also stored in the database mysql.
